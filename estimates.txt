For a Multi-AZ, multi-region database, the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) can be described as follows:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: In the event of an Availability Zone (AZ) outage within a region, the minimum RTO represents the time required to restore the database's availability. With a Multi-AZ configuration, where the database is replicated synchronously across AZs, the RTO can be relatively low. Typically, it involves automatically promoting the standby replica in the unaffected AZ as the new primary instance, which can be accomplished within a matter of minutes. In case of Multi-AZ deployment, standby instance is already running and data is replicated synchronously. This ensures quick recovery.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: In the case of a complete region failure, the minimum RTO involves switching the workload to a different region. This process can take longer compared to an AZ outage, as it requires provisioning resources, configuring the database in the new region, and restoring data from backups or replication. The exact time would depend on the size of the database, the amount of data to be transferred, and the complexity of the setup. Time to bring read replica as a standalone primary instance, it is reasonable to expect an RTO ranging from a few hours to potentially several hours or more, depending on the specific setup and the efficiency of the disaster recovery processes. Time to apply new DNS changes in application to connect to new end point can take minimum 45-60 minutes for RTO.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: The Recovery Point Objective refers to the maximum tolerable amount of data loss in case of a failure. In the event of an AZ outage, a Multi-AZ, multi-region database configuration can offer a relatively low RPO. Since the data is replicated synchronously to the standby replica in another AZ within the same region, the RPO can be minimal, often achieving near real-time replication. This means that the data loss is typically limited to just a few seconds or less. Considering this, minimum RPO for a single AZ is 5 minutes

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: In the unfortunate event of a complete region failure, the minimum RPO for a multi-region database configuration would depend on the replication mechanism employed. If asynchronous replication is utilized, there could be a delay between the last replicated transaction and the moment of failure. As a result, the RPO could be longer, potentially ranging from a few seconds to several minutes or more, depending on the replication lag. On the other hand, if synchronous replication is implemented across regions, the RPO can be significantly lower, similar to the RPO for a single AZ outage, it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get into Available state, typically minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.
